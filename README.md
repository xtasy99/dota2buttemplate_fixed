### Map Building Help
You may notice that there is 2 dota maps, **dota_fixed and dota.vmap**. You can choose one of these for it to be the map for people to play in.
**What's the difference?**
- dota_fixed.vmap changes its terrain every season. The seasons are Autumn, Spring, Summer, and Winter. It also adds a weather effect suited to the season.
- dota.vmap is the normal dota map which you play in normally.

You might notice that at your first build, the minimap is just grey or blank. There's an easy way to fix that. Before building the map, tick the "Create new minimap on load" and build. Once you've built the map and the minimap is still blank, click "Run (Skip Build)" again and it will fix itself.
