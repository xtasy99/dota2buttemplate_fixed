You can find the hero abilities/talents Key Values (KV) file on the folder "_base/".

Summons and some neutral creeps abilities are also in this heroes KV.

Make a copy of any KV file and paste in the folder "heroes/" to customize the KVs.

Only KVs in the folder "heroes/" will be loaded into the game.

If you don't want to modify all the abilities of a hero, leave only the modified abilities and erase unmodified ones. The game will load them normally.
This can make it easier for you to keep track of your modifications.
